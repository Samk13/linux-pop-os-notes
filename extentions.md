# Pop_OS Extentions

If the web extention is not working you can install extentions with command:

```bash
gnome-extensions install -f <name of downloaded zip file>.zip 
```

You might need to restart your PC to see the extention in `gnome-extentions-app
see: [question](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1403688/although-gnome-shell-integration-extension-is-running-native-host-connector-is)

You can find your gnome-shell version with command: `gnome-shell --version`

Or you can install Extention manager from Pop_Os store and look for the extentions from there.
